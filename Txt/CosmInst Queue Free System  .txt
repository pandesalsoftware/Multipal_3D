CosmInst Queue Free System : 

Create Multiple hair tabs and multiple POS nodes for hairstyles to become children of. 

Only make it so that one hair or cosminst can be under it's respective parent POS node at a time. 


Script One, Rough Idea, based on how Color Picker checks for children of HairPos1 : 


@onready var HairPos1 = $Base_Angel/Armature/Skeleton3D/NeckBone/HairPos1
if HairPos1.get_child_count() > 1: 
	print("HairPos1 has child")
	var HairPosChild1 = HairPos1.get_child(0) 
	HairPosChild1.queue_free()
		

Script Two as advised by Copilot, not a separate function, one that simply tacks itself onto the pre existing hair instancing functions, looking for children and deleting them before adding a new child : 

func donnyhair_inst():
	var DonnyHairScene = preload("res://Meshes/Angels/Hair/HairInstScenes/DonnyHair.tscn")
	var DHinst = DonnyHairScene.instantiate()
	var DonnyHPos = $"../../../../Base_Angel/Armature/Skeleton3D/NeckBone/HairPos1"
	
	# Remove existing children
	for child in DonnyHPos.get_children():
		child.queue_free()
	
	DonnyHPos.add_child(DHinst)
	
	# Checking for Instance
	if is_instance_valid(DHinst):
		# Toggles QF button to Visible
		$TabContainer/Hair/HairOptions/DonnyHairPVW/DonnyHairQF.visible = true
		# Disables the Hair Inst Button
		$TabContainer/Hair/HairOptions/DonnyHairPVW/DonnyHairBTN.disabled = true
		# Toggles Inst Button to Not Visible 
		$TabContainer/Hair/HairOptions/DonnyHairPVW/DonnyHairBTN.visible = false

^ WORKS LIKE A CHARM --- NEED TO UPDATE EYES AND MOUTHS TO BE THE SAME...
- Hair updated
- Eyes updated 
- Mouths updated

Process : 

- Delete QF Button Section
- Copy this and Add underneath var NameHPos line and above NameHPos.add_child(NHinst) line : 

		#Remove Existing Children 
	for child in MandaHPos.get_children():
		child.queue_free()
	#Add Child 

*Note H is for hair
      E is for eyes
      M is for mouths 

- Delete lines underneath If is_instance_valid(NHinst): and replace function lines with pass, make sure to indent before the pass or else the engine becomes very angry with you and will explode. 


* Note : Potentially make POS nodes moveable via animation track and make the save data system save the position of the node as well as the children of the node
