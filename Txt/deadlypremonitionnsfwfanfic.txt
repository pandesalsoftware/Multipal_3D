"Oh? You want to try something new?"

"Well...I've just been thinking about it..." 

"Mm, I can't play stupid. I did hear what you had in mind." 

"Hmph." Zach hoists their body up as York plants their feet firmly to the hard wooden floor.

York lets him take full control as Zach makes a b-line for the bedroom, straight to their underwear drawer. 

York bites his bottom lip as Zach's thoughts become rapid, and almost animalistic. 

Zach chuckles to himself, his humanity sinking in as he feels his cock harden from his fantasies. 

Lucky for them both, they weren't anything too hard to attain. 

No, Zach was a simple creature, and York willing to step forward in any direction he'd lead. 

"Where to next?" 

"Don't you already know?"

York laughs, "Well, yes...I'm just teasing." Zach can feel York's smirk take over their face as he speaks. 

It's always such a comfort to hear his voice coming from their throat, and this feeling went both ways.
