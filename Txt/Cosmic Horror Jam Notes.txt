Story Stuff : 

Petting Zoo in the middle of nowhere, ran by some rich boy rancher. 

You play as Zach who's desperate for a job and willing to do anything, seeing a petting zoo maintenance man position online sounded kind of fun. You're a little weirded out that it's in the middle of the night but for the high pay, you figured, how hard could it be? $1000 for one night. Just while the owner's away. If it goes well enough, he said he'd hire you long term! Sounds great! Sign me up too!...Oh. Wait. I'm a narrator.  

"Due to security purposes, the entrance will be locked until your shift ends." 


"We got a new animal, -Insert Cowboy Name here-, not sure what he eats...You'll just have to figure that our yourself."
