One week after top surgery, Liza sends me a youtube video on the keto diet. 
This is also after updating my profile picture pretty recently. 
Am I still too big? Too fat? Too ugly?
Will I ever be what she wants?
Will I ever look how she wants?
Be as pretty as she wants? 

Why does she have nothing else to tell me or ask me? 
Why is my weight her concern? 
Why does it sting to think about this? 
She didn't call me fat. She only sent a dieting video. 
Why does it make me feel so empty inside? 
Why does Paul want a Christmas list? 
Why do they only want to talk about money or how I look?

The older I get, the lesser I know about them.
